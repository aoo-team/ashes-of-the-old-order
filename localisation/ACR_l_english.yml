 ACR.1.t:0 "Tom Cotton's State of the Union"
 ACR.1.d:0 ""The deadly plague of black separatism that emerged late last year has now spread across the country. The so called 'nation' of New Afrika deceived the world- even their own people of this deadly plague\n\nHere at home, a strange and unsettling hush has fallen over much of the country, as the army secures the country and millions of Americans brace for what's to come. In Atlanta, Agusta, Columbus,  preparation for the plague has ended. The plague has arrived in force. The urgent battle to suppress it has begun." - Tom Cotton"

 ACR.2.t:0 "A Citizen's Contribution"
 ACR.2.d:0 "Jeffery McMiller was just another ordinary southern citizen when the war started. He didn't care 'bout "loyalty" or "patriotism" before the war, he just wanted to live the good old American life. And of course, the black nationalists wanted none of that, with they're lofty ideals of "progressivism" and whatnot. So Jeffery did what every American did when the war broke out - he bought a gun. He had to protect his family at all costs, from rioters, from the commies, from the government, from everyone. But he had no desire to die. He had no delusions of grandeur, no Wanna go down in a blaze of glory. So as fronts shifted, his countrymen died, cities burned while Jeffery sat at home, makin' sure his daughter and wife were safe. But the fight came to him at last. When New Afrika rebelled, the Confederacy was in desperate need of weaponry. As he sat on his porch, a confederate officer, dressed in his light grey, came and asked him if he had any guns. Of course, Jefferey answered that he did. So the officer gave him a choice. Sign up, or give up your gun. Jefferey sighed, went to the livin' room, brought the gun to the officer, and watched in silence as the officer took his gun and walked to his neighbors."
