 # IDEAS
 
 WFF_Crossroad_of_Ideas:0 "Crossroad of Ideas"
 WFF_Crossroad_of_Ideas_desc:0 "The United States of America, or as foreigners refer to us as: the Western Federal Forces, has a reputation for its adherence to free speech and free political sphere. But although this is the envy of even many developed countries, it also creates a problem. Traditionally the United States had two, or the occasional three parties vying for power, but here, extreme factionalism pouring over from refugees and those already in our border has grown prominent. This has lead to our country's politics not being fought between the moderate parties, but the far-right and the far-left. It is not uncommon to find street brawls and fights within Congress over the question of which extreme to go to. The moderate parties are shrinking and many fear for the future of the nation.\n\n§RBut in the end, there will be one party standing.§!"

 WFF_Unstable_Government:0 "Unstable Government"
 WFF_Unstable_Government_desc:0 "Our government has been pushed to the fringe of existence time and time again. It struggled through the Great Second American Civil War, it struggled through the following anarchy, instability, famines, raids, and warlords. It has survived all these threats, but it seems that this is not how our government will fall. It seems that our government will fall from the inside out, the extreme factionalism created by the far-left and the far-right parties has brought down a clear divide in Congress, and not only this, but the people who support our nation have begin to commit acts of terrorism against the other parties. And although the moderates still hold majority in Congress, they do not hold the majority of the voters, they must keep the majority or collision is inevitable."

 WFF_Extreme_Factionalism:0 "Extreme Factionalism"
 WFF_Extreme_Factionalism_desc:0 "Effectively, there are two parties in the new Congress of the United States of America. There is the far-right block, containing three parties: the American Nazi Party (ANP), the American National Socialist Worker's Party (ANSWP), and the National Alliance (NA). And, there is the far-left block, containing another three parties: the Socialist Party of America (SPA), the Social Democratic Alliance (SDA), and the Freedom Front (FF). Then, there are the moderate parties, of which there are two: the Republican party, and the Democratic Party. Currently, the Republican and the Democratic parties are in a 'Moderate Alliance' of sorts and are attempting to combat the growing tides of factionalism and radicalism. But, there is one final party. The Military, although meant to be detatched from politics, has signifigant influence on the politics of the nation. And, if not kept watched on, may become too strong to stop a military coup. One thing is certain, a miracle is needed to save America. For nothing else can."
 
 # Decisions

 WFF_power_struggle:0 "The Political Battleground"
 WFF_power_struggle_desc:0 "The situation in Congress is getting worse everyday, more an more politicians are leaning to the far-left or the far-right and the moderate parties (the Republican-Democrat Alliance) are shrinking. And throughout this, the leaders of these parties will stop at nothing to become the next leader of the United States. Although many of these men are corrupt and evil at heart, they have managed to captivate crowds of people, and have hundreds of thousands of supporters across the country. The political balance of the country hangs on a knife's edge, and at any moment, the parties will strike.\n\nThe Influence of the country's party leaders are as follows:\n\n§CModerates§!:\n\n§CMichael Bennett (Democrat)§!:  [GetLiberalPopularity] ([?liberal_support])\n§vKen Buck (Republican)§!:  [GetDemocraticPopularity] ([?democratic_support])\n\n§RFar-Left§!:\n\n§RPat Noble (Far-Left Conservative)§!:  [GetDemsocPopularity] ([?demsoc_support])\n§xSam Webb (Far-Left Moderate)§!:  [GetCommunismPopularity] ([?communism_support])\n§pChristopher Helali (Far-Left Radical) ([?libsoc_support])§!:  [GetLibsocPopularity] ([?libsoc_support])\n\n§aFar-Right§!:\n\n§aJames Mattis (Far-Right Conservative)§!:  [GetAuthdemPopularity] ([?authdem_support])\n§tJames Nolan Mason (Far-Right Moderate)§!:  [GetFascismPopularity] ([?fascism_support])\n§cJeff Schoep (Far-Right Radical)§!:  [GetUltranationalismPopularity] ([?ultranationalism_support])\n\n§gMilitary§!:\n\n§gMark Milley (Despot)§!:  [GetNeutralityPopularity] ([?neutrality_support])\n "

 wff.1.t:0 "A New America"
 wff.1.d:0 "The New America is one in shambles, the Second American Civil War has left the country in ruins. The modern Americas resemble little of the superpowers they represented during World War II and the Cold War.But hope is not gone yet and we must make sure it does not leave the hearts of our citizens.\n\nIn crises like these, many Presidents collapsed under the pressure, but there is one President that stands out from the rest, Franklin Delano Roosevelt. He inspired the American people in a time where hope was limited, so we will attempt to mimic that. We will restart the State of the Union speech to the people and we will remake FDR's signature fireside chat.\n\nThere is still hope in the Americas, we just have to find it."
 wff.1.a:0 "As long is hope is alive, so are we."

 wff.2.t:0 "The Status Quo"
 wff.2.d:0 "The United States is undoubtedly in a runined state, a shell of its former self and outside nations make no efforts not to exclaim that. Although to the American people we are still alive, we are still the hope of a better future that the colonists in 1776 dreamt about. Our ownly problem is that we lack the support of the American people to remake America.\n\nThe will of the American people has been broken, and our job will be to build it back up. Without the support of the people, the United States is nothing. So we are again seeking inspiration from previous Presidents, John F. Kennedy. He inspired the American people in a way that most Presidents never had. But the one part of his presidency that stood out was in one of his speeches where he exclaimed to the American people, 'Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country.'\n\nThis will be the dawn of a new era in our history and whether for the better or for the worse, the American people will persist."
 wff.2.a:0 "A future left uncertain."

 wff.3.t:0 "The Northern Revolt"
 wff.3.d:0 "Reports from the Northern territories suggest that the insurgent movements are increasing and they have laid siege to the City of St. Helena. This is no regular protest, to them it is a full scale revolution. If we don't act soon, it is clear that we will lose another piece of American liberty and freedom to the increasing wave of rebels and bandits. May god help us all."
 wff.3.a:0 "The only option is to respond with force."
 wff.3.b:0 "They will listen to reason, we will negotiate."

 wff.4.t:0 "The Next Chapter"
 wff.4.d:0 "There is only one way forward, and it is conquest. The American people have been ununited for too long, and they long to be one nation again. But many of these people are still being oppressed under regimes such as those in the territories to the South or the Northwest of us. President Milley is sure of only one thing, and that is that the United State will expand and that it will be through force. He quotes 'They have sparked the fire of their so-called revolutions. Well, we are the ever-blazing fire of freedom and liberty. And we shall do just that. Fight fire with fire.'"
 wff.4.a:0 "The time has come, to rejoin the Union brothers."

 wff.5.t:0 "The Freedom Speech"
 wff.5.d:0 "James Mattis, current leader of the United State walked up onto the makeshift speaking platform in front of the hastily constructed white house in Denver. He avoided the repeated camera flashes from members of the crowd, predominantly reporters. He could see the anticipation in their faces, years had gone by without any improvement in the state of the country, they were waiting for good news. And for once, he had some.\n\nHe began his speech with 'This government, a government for the people, by the people, and of the people should reflect just that. And throughout the turmoil and devestation brought to America in the last two decades we have persevered. But we never prevailed.' then seeing the confused looks on the many of the faces of members of the crowd gathering before him, he elaborated. 'Democracy, as it was during all times of American struggle, has persevered. And therefore, I will be resigning my post, and I shall be restoring democracy to the United States. Democracy failed once. It shall not happen again.'\n\nMattis waited, watching the stunned expressions of those in the crowd, and after what seemed like eternity, one man began to clap, then another, and another, until the whole crowd was in applause of the speech. He smiled, although he had just resigned, he had achieved his goal. The restoration of democracy."
 wff.5.a:0 "Democracy perseveres, and so does the American spirit."

 wff.6.t:0 "The 2018 Elections"
 wff.6.d:0 "With the first new election in the United States, hopefully one of many to come, we have three major candidates. On the far left side of the political sphere we have leader of the American Socialist Party Pat Noble, who has expressed his support in the empowering of the working class, and the further integration of union politcs into the government. He pledges to reform America for the better.\n\nOn the less severe, and moderate left side of the political sphere, a politician by the name of Michael Bennett is running for office. Much like Noble pledged, he pledged to make the American workers' standard of life increase, but he said that some of Noble's policies are foolish and would destroy the economy, and has taken a more moderate approach on his campaign.\n\nAnd finally, on the right side of the political sphere, there is politician Ken Buck who has publicly voiced that the protection of the American people and the revitalization of the economy will be his two major concerns if he ever makes it to office. He has publicly shamed both Bennett and Noble for taking too 'Socialist' of a stance and says that either candidate would bring the United States down the root of Communism. Much like that of the oppressive Soviet Union.\n\nIt is now the American peoples' turn to decide. They must choose wisely."

Buck felt the tension in the air, as the reporters began to file into te crowd, and under their scrutinous gaze he started his speech. 'My term as president has only just begun, but the fruits of my labor have started to show, our economy is improving, our military is now capable of defending our nation. I have stabilized the United States.'\n\nHe continued 'But, I do not intend to make that the extend of the reforms and changes that will happen to this country during my presidency. The areas around us, populated with tyrannical governments and corrupt leaders are our brothers and sisters. In the last two decades we have lost more than any one man could apprehend. But it is now time to retake the territories lost. It is time to rejoin with our brothers and sisters.'\n\n'In the 1800s, after the First American Civil War, we reunited with the Confederate States after the war, they became part of the country once again. ANd now it is my mission to do the same with the rest of the United States. There is only one path forward.
