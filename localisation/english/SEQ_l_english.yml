 SEQ_Legacy_Project_Ghost_Wind:0 "The Legacy of Project Ghost Wind"
 SEQ_Legacy_Project_Ghost_Wind_desc:0 "Many years ago, before the fall of the United States, a secret group of generals and scientists worked together in the dying days of the republic to create a secret store of confiscated WMDs they planned to use should the world come to a end. While their fate is unknown, we happened to come across the store of chemical weapons deep within the Broken Arrow compound. The compound is vast, and we can send out §Yscavenging missions§! to find more WMDs. These can be used against our enemies, and provide large §Gbonuses§! against the survivialists we §Yfight§! or §Yraid§!. However the stock of WMDs is not endless so we should use them wisely. \n\n Our stock of §CSarin Gas§! is: [?SEQ.seq_sarin_gas|-0] units\n\n Our stock of §OVX Gas§! is: [?SEQ.seq_vx_gas|-0] units.\n\nWe suspect that the remaining stock of WMDs in Broken Arrow is: [ROOT.SEQ_GetBrokenArrowStock]"

 SEQ_Personality_Cult_desc:0 "Our wise Father brought us together into a band of brothers with one goal: serving him. As we seek to spread the fear of the Father across the land, we must do all in our power to spread the cult of the Father and enlighten the soft and degenerate peoples around us. There is only one goal in life, and that is to live, and die for our Father.\n\nThe power of the Father's Cult of Personality holds sway over roughly [?SEQ.seq_father_cult|-0]% our land.\n\nLetting the Cult's sway fall too low can result in mutinies and revolts. Do Everything possible to keep it above 20%"

 SEQ.3.t:0 "Welcome To The Void"
 SEQ.3.d:0 "Thomas Addison was roused from his sleep by the loud guttral yelling of masked men as they kicked open the door of the wretchedly filthy barracks. 'Wake up you dogs! I'll have the officer carry out a decimation if you aren't up in five seconds!' Addison jumped to his feet, shivering as his weary feet met the freezing floor. One by one, the other prisoners lined up in a perfectly ordered line as a small but stout officer marched in, carrying a fine, thin whip. 'The Father is not pleased with quality of the guns we have received from this camp' he growled through fine white teeth. 'He has decided it is time for stricter discipline around here. The last camp commander was soft, but I...I am not gentlmen.' Addison sucked in his breath as the officer grabbed the shivering old man in the front of the line and kicked him to the floor. 'It is time to set a example' the officer said quietly, with a almost sickeningly soft intonation. He then proceded to lash the man. Hot, angry red welts formed on the man's back.\n\n The other prisoners watched, and uttered not a word. It was a lesson none of them would forget."
