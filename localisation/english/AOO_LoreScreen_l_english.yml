 COUNTRY_LORE_WDC:0 "§G-----WESTERN FEDERAL FORCES-----§!\n\nAfter years of being beaten back and cast away from the people we stood to protect. We are the successor of the §BUnited States§!. But in 2002, our disastrous decline started with the outbreak of the §BSecond American Civil War§!, slowly we lost ground, not to our enemies, but to our friends, states broke away from us one by one as the war drove the country into further exhaustion. Our wills may have been broken, seeing our former friends and allies leave us.\n\nBut that does not mean the story is over. So long as freedom stands in the midst of the chaos of the Americas there is hope, hope for a better future. We may not see it in our lifetimes but in the lifetimes of our children, or even our grandchildren. Although the bonfire of democracy may have been reduced into embers, there is still fuel for the fire to burn. All we need is to fan the flames, ignite the fire, so that once again the United States can return.\n\nAlthough there is hope, we must be careful not to be too optimistic, there are forces working against us too. The §gauthoritarians§! in the country led by military general Mark Milley advocate for a 'stronger' more nationalist and 'patriotic' United States. They argue that the forces of democracy failed us and that a new ideology must take place. One with a §gleader with an iron will§!. This party, known as the §RRepublicans§! have an opposition as well. The §BDemocrats§! fight for what they believe is the las bastion of democracy, and will not compromise on anything that will lessen their freedom and spoil their beloved democracy. We must choose.\n\n§ROne thing is for sure though, the United States will never be the same.§!\n\n§Y++++UNIQUE MECHANICS+++++§!\n\n§L+++Determine the future leaders of our country and its people§!\n§L+++Conquer surrounding countries while monitoring the support for the opposing faction§!\n§L+++Either persuade surrounding countries to rejoin the United States or take them by force!§!\n§L+++Reunite the United States and engage in World Affairs once again!§!\n"

 COUNTRY_LORE_SEA:0 "§G-----SEATTLE PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC ASSEMBLY-----§!\n\nAfter the disastrous fall-apart of the §BUnited States§! in 2002, it didn't take us long to realize the immense boon the destruction of the old order brought about. Millions in the nation groaned as they lived and toiled under a system of brutal capitalistic oppression. While the old United States promised such things as 'freedom' and 'democracy', it didn't take long to look around and see the suffering workers labelling for non-living wages. Basic rights, such as healthcare and a right to a universal basic income were ridiculed and denied by the fascistic system of oppression. While there were a few brave voices speaking out against this system, they were never given a ample opportunity to plan a restructure society. The fall-apart of the §BUnited States§!, caused by its own greed and imperialistic avarice, gave us a chance to rebuild society anew.\n\nAs the ashes settled, a new vision for a society began to take shape. One built by and for, the people. Of course, people can't just organize themselves, and so it was wisely decided by a council of elected representatives to create a executive power, called the chairperson.\n\nAs we stand ready for the future, §YKshama Sawant§! begins here tenure, accountable to the people and People's Council, she is sure to take our Assembly far. However, there are those revisionists and reactionaries who seek to challenge her rule. Foremost of these is §RMichael DuBois§!, Leader of the §RHardliners faction§!, who seek believe a all-powerful executive is the only way for a truly fair and anti-reactionary society to be built. At the opposite end, §GSamuel Durkhan§! leads the §Greformists§!, who despite the name are nothing more than a pack of reactionaries and libertarian capitalists. Sawant has many challenges ahead, and it remains to be seen what direction our mighty workers shall take. Forwards!\n\n§Y++++UNIQUE MECHANICS+++++§!\n\n§L+++Determine the future of the people of Seattle in the People's Council§!\n§L+++Nationalize a variety of industriesl§!\n§L+++Spread the Revolution through Washington!§!\n"
