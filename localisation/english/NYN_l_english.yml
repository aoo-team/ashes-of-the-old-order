 albany.1.t:0 "Thatcherism"
 albany.1.d:0 "“Unit 1, we’ve got a report of another riot about to break out on Church Street going onto Walnut. We’ve got officers stationed there already but we need reinforcements.”\n\n“Heard ya loud and clear. We’ll be pulling onto 6th to stop any further movement.”\n\nAs the second cop cruiser approached the scene of the protest, the chanting cries could be heard before the speakers could be seen. “Zerickbringe unser land! Zerickbringe unser land!” It was still surprising to the local government that the protesting would continue through the winter.\n\nStopped by officers on both sides, a sound reminiscent of a pistol filled the street before the hissing of a tear gas canister fell in the middle of the group of protesters. The muffled shouting of an officer could be heard over the yelling and the police officers on both ends of the street started moving inwards on the protesters, using their service-issued rifles to knock the protesters to the ground as well as liberally using pepper spray on the ones who could still breath through the combination of tear gas and the cold, dry air. After being pushed to the ground, the officers would hold the protesters against the wet pavement, some of the more audacious police using their steel-toed boots to hold the protesters’ heads to the ground, and put both their hands in handcuffs, to later be sent to the Lehigh County Prison as political prisoners.\n\nOutside of the box that the officers had formed around the protesters being arrested, the friends and family of the protesters involved could be heard crying and shouting to the ones arrested, some even trying to get through the barricade of policemen, though their actions were met with the same treatment as the protesters inside the box."
 albany.1.a:0 "When will they ever learn?"
 
 albany.2.t:0 "Reaganomics"
 albany.2.d:0 "Quickly after Cuomo’s ascension in the new Albanian Republic came the first wave of new legislation, which he took great inspiration from Reagan’s tax policy in forming. All across the board taxes were reduced, enticing investors and greatly reducing the burden on middle class and lower class families. After years of living in constant war economy and high taxation, it was greatly appreciated by the population.\n\nHowever, soon after came the cut to the many of the social services many Albanians were utilizing to survive. This move made Cuomo’s approval rating plummet, and some of the first protests started. Leftists of all varieties, socialists, communists, social democrats, anarchists, all came in unity in the protest of the relinquishing of basic social services. Furthermore, their militancy only began to increase as Cuomo refused at every point to give into their demands, as well as using the money taken from social services to put into the police force to help suppress them."
 albany.2.a:0 "Damn radicals."
 
 albany.3.t:0 "The Honourable"
 albany.3.d:0 "“I have a proposition for you.”\n\nCuomo’s right hand man, Joseph Percoco, sat across the table from him, his finger pensively holding up his chin.\n\nHis words slithered off his tongue like a snake as he began to speak again, “We both know of the ongoing riots happening in Lehigh from the ‘Germans’ there. If you give me a cut of the money going towards some of the reconstruction efforts here locally, maybe I can help you deal with your rebel issue.”\n\nIn thought, Cuomo started not at Percoco but seemingly through him, considering what it would mean for him morally and what it’d mean for him politically. \n\n“Look, you don’t need to go through with it. Some money going towards the local government there to, erm, incline them to dealing a little more harshly. And you won’t even have to be involved.”\n\n“How much do you want for it?”\n\n“Three hundred thousand should be enough.”\n\nCuomo bounced the number around his head for a bit before finally looking at Percoco clearly. As he stuck his hand out, Percoco’s mouth formed into a smile from ear to ear, shaking his hand, and getting up from his seat."

 albany.10.d:0 "His eyes glazed up towards the ceiling where he found the clock, and back towards his phone he had been holding in his hand below the counter, but both read the same time.\n\nTen thirteen in the morning.\n\nA sigh escaped his lips and he began thinking of what he could be doing. But rather what filled his mind were the stresses of school, the anxiety of his family life, and the ever-ongoing protests and food shortages all around his country.\n\nBefore he had noticed he suddenly snapped back to reality, a customer waiting for him. In a surprised voice he deliberately however still quite monotonically said, “Hi, thank you for shopping today, did you find everything alright?” The question was so common to him that he often forgot it was a question and more of a daily thought barely passing through his mind, bringing the same feelings of pain and monotony of that of an alarm clock. At least tomorrow was his payday. 150 dollars of staring at a pair of doors and pressing buttons. \n\nBeep, beep, beep, beep, ringing through his head and going on. Each item scanned through and the money exchanged hands, totalling up to more than his weekly salary despite it just being some middle of the line clothes. Branded in his own mind by the brand which surrounded him, he spoke again, “Thank you for shopping, come again soon.” The cart rolled and bumped out to the door as he looked back at the clock.\n\nTen fifteen."
