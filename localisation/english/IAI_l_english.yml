 # Events
 IAI.1.t:0 "15th UNITY-PACT CONVENTION"
 IAI.1.d:0 "Politicians nervously attended to their various business about in the State Capitol Building, which was the centre of Iowan politics. However the stressful environment was being perpetuated by one event in particular, the 15th and final Unity-Pact Convention. The Unity-Pact was an agreement signed by the pre-collapse politicians of Iowa and the Midwestern Federal Forces in Iowa, who have now turned into the Unity-Guard. When Iowa was a brand-new state that was defined by chaos and uncertain and fluid borders, the Unity-Guard was formed and became more and more popular amongst the population as they stabilised the front-lines with the other warlords and kept Iowa safe and secure, the politicians were eventually forced to co-operate with them, however the Unity-Pact Government protocols have expired and only fate and the Iowan people will determine the electorate."
 IAI.1.a:0 "Iowa's Flaming Vanguard, the Unity-Guard and the Iowan Fascist Party!"
 IAI.1.b:0 "The Old Order will forever burn on! The Liberal-Conservative Coalition Party!"

 IAI.2.t:0 "STATUS OF THE DES-MOINES POLICE DEPARTMENT"
 IAI.2.d:0 "Iowa can often be seen as a very odd state, one surrounded by fortifications, checkpoints and barbed wire, however some remnants from the old order remain, especially the law enforcement system. The Des-Moines Police Department is also a very interesting case, as it has had a fierce rivalry with the Unity-Guard and their military police ever since emergency powers were deactivated. They are the primarily aligned to the  LCC and seen as the party's  main security provider and give some solace against the threat of a Guard coup d'etat."
 IAI.2.a:0 " A constant reminder of the thin blue line."

 IAI.3.t:0 "A SILENT NIGHT, NOTHING TO BE EXPECTED"
 IAI.3.d:0 "It was a cold, windy and business night in Des-Moines, with traffic being especially heavy as everyone was returning from their workplaces to their homes. However, the Unity-Guard's work had only just begun. Dressed in all black, several teams of elite Guardsmen had broken into LCC-aligned politician's homes and captured them, tying them up and holding them to gun point. Their homes were vandalized, with furniture being thrown around and broken, and money being taken. All of this was of course to look like thug work. With pistols directed to their faces, they were "convinced" to drop their commitment to the upcoming election. No one had died that night."
 IAI.3.a:0 "An operation well done"

 IAI.4.t:0 "POLITICS TO BE DONE IN OFFICE AND ON THE STREETS"
 IAI.4.d:0 "A standard Unity-Guard patrol, consisting of three Humvees was moving throughout West Des-Moines when suddenly their route had been blocked. Their stood in front of them civilians wearing various outfits, or just everyday work clothes. Several flags were raised behind them, American flags, Iowan flags, and peculiar enough, an Anarchist flag. The civilians held baseball bats, sticks, 2x4's, various other blunt objects, and some with rifles and pistols. They demanded the Unity-Guard disband and cease it's authoritarian ways, however the guardsmen refused and demanded they back away. Much to their surprise, from the alleyways and rooftops, even more civilian militiamen appeared. The soldiers nervous, and unexperienced with this type of scenario were forced to back away at the risk of being gunned down or rushed."
 IAI.4.a:0 "They will run into chaos when liberty decides to fight back."
